# BOOKY

The code was downloaded from the hosting server and my not function probabrly if ran incorrectly.

The core files of the project can be found in the ```public_html``` folder; however, the ```node_modules``` file was included as well as it was part of the host files.

In case the ```node_modules``` folder causes any errors remove it.

Thanks
